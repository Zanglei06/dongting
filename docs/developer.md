The project is still under development, so there is no complete documentation.

# Build and setup IDE

The Dongting project outputs two jars for users: dongting-client.jar requires Java 8, and dongting-server.jar
requires Java 11. However, compiling the entire project requires Java 17 because the benchmark module requires Java 17.

Importing the entire project into the IDE may lead to compilation errors because the test code depends on some files 
generated by the protobuf compiler. If your IDE does not automatically set these up, follow the steps below to 
configure them manually. At first, run the following command to generate the source files:
```
mvn clean compile test-compile
```
Then add the source file path generated by the plugin to the *sources* in the IDE. For example:

# Run simple benchmark

Open RaftBenchmark class, run the main method, that's all. 

There are some parameters you can set in source code, see comments.
